# Application development of car interconnected based on Ad Hoc Network Model 
    Through the study of practical problems, vehicle ad hoc networks and 
    multi-sensor data fusion technology and other related technology, 
    we design a smart car's motion control system and interconnected system 
    which based on ad hoc network model in this project.
    
    This smart car uses ARM11 processer as core and embedded Linux as operating system, 
    including two function modules' design: embedded system module and single-chip microcomputer control module,
    according to the characteristics of the hardware platform and embedded software,
    we design the control program of single-chip microcomputer , ARM11 processer and PC client.
    
    We finally realize the system which can transmit control command, 
    vide message and warning signal between car and car or car and PC.

Keywords: VANET /Intelligent Vehicle/ARM11

# Top Design
    Hardware system mainly contains : Embedded System SOC, Data Storage, interface, motor, vehicle model and power manager.
    Software system use the Linux System and kernel driver.
